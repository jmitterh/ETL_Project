# ETL Project
## Extract, Transform, Load:
* **Extract** is the process of reading data from a dataset. In this stage, the data is collected, often from multiple and different types of sources.

* **Transform** is the process of converting the extracted data from its previous form into the form it needs to be in so that it can be placed into storage, such as a database. Transformation occurs by using rules or lookup tables or by combining the data with other data.

* **Load** is the process of writing the data into the target database.

### Datasets you intend to use: 
- Yahoo Finance API: https://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/API,Documentation/view/v1/
- Weather csv data: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
- Natural Disasters data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_in_the_United_States

### What useful investigation could be done with the final database:

> What effect does weather have with with United States economy based on the stock market index of large company performances? The final database can tell us the correlation between historical weather, natural disaster, and historical stock market behavior, with the common variable of time. 

### Whether final database will be relational or non-relational. Why

> Relational Database. We have data that can be normalized to query the data. We also can relate all data with time.
