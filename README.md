### Datasets you intend to use:
#### Stock Market api data: 
- Yahoo Finance API
- Weather csv data: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
- Natural Disasters data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_in_the_United_States

### What useful investigation could be done with the final database:

> The final database can tell us the correlation between historical weather, natural disaster, and historical stock market behavior, with the common variable of time by year.

### Whether final database will be relational or non-relational. Why

> Relational Database. We have data that can be normalized to query using sql. We also can relate all data with time.
